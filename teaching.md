I have enjoyed teaching a wide range of topics at different levels, from Highschool science to graduate level courses in Physics. I am experinced in novel methods of teaching science through the initiatives at the Physics Department at SFU and certificate programs like "University Teaching and Learning".

Here is a summary of my teaching and supervisory experience:
